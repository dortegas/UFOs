# UFOs

## Overview
UFO Sightings with JavaScript is a project where Dana is a data journalist, and she had the opportunity to write about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. Because McMinnville is famous for its UFOs sightings phenomenon, Dana decided to write about this topic with the technical support of JavaScriptâ€™s visual functionality. Dana planned to use JavaScript to display UFOs sightings on a Web page table that supports her article and includes filters to fine-tune the results. JavaScript language provides tools to manipulate the data by adding filters.
